# Search DevDocs

## About
This is a [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com) plugin allowing you to easily search the DevDocs documentation.

The plugin code is based on [Can I Use It Search Plugin](https://github.com/Azd325/sublime-text-caniuse) by Tim Kleinschmidt (tim.kleinschmidt@gmail.com)

## Usage
Highlight text, right click & click "Search DevDocs" to open a new tab on your web browser with the info. You can also use the shortcut.

## Installation
The easiest way to install this is with [Package Control](http://wbond.net/sublime\_packages/package\_control).

* If you just went and installed Package Control, you probably need to restart Sublime Text 2 before doing this next bit.
* Bring up the Command Palette (Command+Shift+p on OS X, Control+Shift+p on Linux/Windows).
* Select "Package Control: Install Package" (it'll take a few seconds)
* Select DevDocs when the list appears.

Package Control will automatically keep Git up to date with the latest version.

If you have some problems or improvements with it, [contact me](https://github.com/vitorbritto/sublime-devdocs/issues) via GitHub.
